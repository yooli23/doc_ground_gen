I'm really happy that people try to protect parts of nature, I'm always worried it'll all disappear someday.","The National Park Service (NPS) is an agency of the United States federal government that manages all national parks, many national monuments, and other conservation and historical properties with various title designations.","I agree. It's unfortunate that we need the government to step in, but it's great having NPS manage and conserve these parks. ","Yes, I agree. I think it's really important to protect the natural world. The National Park Service has been around since 1872, so it's been around a long time."
