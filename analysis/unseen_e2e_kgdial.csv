4051,Bodybuilding supplement,I guess that would be some concentrated protein..,In 1950s with recreational and competitive bodybuilding becoming increasingly popular Irvin P. Johnson began to popularize and market egg-based protein powders marketed specifically at bodybuilders and physical athletes.,"There may be some reasoning to it. I guess if it's not harmful, what's the worst that could happen, right? Irvin P. Johnson, a competitive bodybuilder from the 1950s, around the time when that stuff was becoming really popular, he popularized egg-based protein powders. Probably not far off from what we see now. And then since the '70s and '80s, the market has just increased dramatically for bodybuilding supplements.",i agree . i think it ' s a very interesting idea . i ' m sure it ' s a lot of a lot of negative effects . i ' m sure it ' s a bit more into that .
